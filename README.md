## Tech Used 
React: I decided on React for this project to refine my skills with front-end development. The speed and usability of React allowed me to be able to load multiple things almost instantly on the same page, and cut down on the need to load new pages. 

MongoDB: The amazing part of MongoDB when it came to this project was the ability to adjust and change models on the fly especially when you're not sure exactly what data you might need when it comes to calling in a sizable amount of information from an API.
